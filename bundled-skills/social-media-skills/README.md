## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

# Install specific skills
npx skills add blacktwist/social-media-skills --skill post-writer-sms hook-writer-sms

# List available skills
npx skills add blacktwist/social-media-skills --list
```

This automatically installs to your `.agents/skills/` directory (and symlinks into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code compatibility).

### Option 2: Clone and Copy

Clone the entire repo and copy the skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blacktwist/social-media-skills.git
cp -r social-media-skills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 3: Git Submodule

Add as a submodule for easy updates:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/blacktwist/social-media-skills.git .agents/social-media-skills
```

Then reference skills from `.agents/social-media-skills/skills/`.

### Option 4: Fork and Customize

1. Fork this repository
2. Customize skills for your specific needs
3. Clone your fork into your projects

### Option 5: SkillKit (Multi-Agent)

Use [SkillKit](https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit) to install skills across multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.):

```bash
# Install all skills

## Tool Integrations

### BlackTwist (primary)

[BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app/mcp) is the recommended MCP integration for this skill set. When the BlackTwist MCP server is connected to your Claude environment, skills use it directly for:

- Publishing and scheduling posts
- Fetching analytics and engagement data
- Managing drafts and queued content
- Tracking follower growth

When BlackTwist is not available, skills fall back to advisory mode — generating content and instructions for manual posting.
